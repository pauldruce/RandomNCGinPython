# Random non-commutative geometry in Python

The overall aim of this repository is to produce a useful framework to investigate the different actions one can use to study random non-commutative geometry.

The primary purpose is to provide a framework for rapid development. From concept to working code in as little time as possible. If its useful, we can then speed up the code.
